This repository is my attempt at cloning the MacBook webpage on Apple's website to display my understanding of UI.

Apple MacBook Air Clone
Overview
This project aims to create a simple HTML webpage that emulates the navigation and layout style of the Apple website, specifically focusing on the MacBook Air product. The page includes a responsive navigation bar, banner sections, and detailed information about the MacBook Air, highlighting its features and specifications.

Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file containing the webpage's structure.
css/normalize.min.css: A reset stylesheet using normalize.css to ensure consistent default styling across different browsers.
css/styles.css: The main stylesheet for custom styling.
images: Folder containing images used in the project.
js/script.js: JavaScript file for adding a sticky behavior to the navigation bar on scroll.

HTML Structure
The HTML file (index.html) is organized into several sections:

Header Section: Contains the navigation bar and banner sections.
The navigation bar includes links to various Apple product categories.
Banner sections provide information and links related to MacBook Air.
Hero Section: Displays a prominent image of the MacBook Air.
Feature Text Section: Describes the MacBook Air's features, emphasizing the Apple M1 chip.
CPU Section: Details the 8-core CPU of the M1 chip.
GPU Section: Describes the 8-core GPU and its graphics capabilities.
Grid Group One: Presents information about battery life and thermal efficiency.
Machine Learning Section: Discusses the machine learning capabilities of the M1 chip.

CSS Styling
normalize.min.css: Provides a consistent baseline styling across different browsers.
styles.css: Contains custom styles for the project, defining the appearance of various elements, including the navigation bar, banners, and sections.

JavaScript Behavior
The script.js file contains JavaScript code to make the navigation bar sticky on scroll. When the user scrolls down the page, the script adds a "sticky" class to the navigation bar, ensuring it remains fixed at the top of the screen.

Usage
You can view the live demo via the link or clone the repository on your local device and open the index.html file in a web browser to view the Apple MacBook Air clone webpage. Scroll down to explore the different sections and features. The navigation bar will become sticky as you scroll.
